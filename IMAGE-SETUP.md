# 🖼️ Image Setup for TrenchPad

## 📍 Current Issue
The logo is not loading because it needs to be in the correct location.

## ✅ Quick Fix

**Copy your jito-img.png to this exact location:**

```
jito-spa/public/trenchpad-logo.png
```

## 🚀 Commands

```bash
# From the jito folder
cd jito-spa
cp ../jito-img.png public/trenchpad-logo.png
npm run dev
```

## 📂 File Structure Should Look Like:

```
jito-spa/
├── public/
│   ├── trenchpad-logo.png  ← Your brain/trading image goes here
│   └── grid.svg
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── layout.tsx
```

## ✨ Result

Your stunning brain/trading logo will appear:
- 🏠 **Header**: Small logo with border glow
- 🎯 **Professional branding** throughout the site

If the image still doesn't load, it will show a "TP" fallback with an error message in the console telling you the exact path needed.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If logo doesn't appear:
1. Check console for error message
2. Verify file is at `jito-spa/public/trenchpad-logo.png`
3. Refresh the page (`Ctrl+F5`)

That's it! 🎨
